Given the fact that you are reading this post, I do not need to tell you that if you are not 100% happy (not 100% satisfied. 100% HAPPY) with your job or career and have not looked into learning to code than you must. Since I do not have to tell you this, I will instead offer a few pieces of advice on how to reach your goals more rapidly. Instead of telling you about where to go to find the best  screencasts, reading books, and cranking lines of code in order to become a software craftsman.

Instead, what follows is a list of non-technical activities you should do to become a software craftman. This list is specific to Ruby developers but you should read the high level patterns that can apply to any programming language.


## Build an Arsenal of Tools

Your laptop is not your tool. Your laptop is your tool shed. The applications you use and tips you pick up along your journey are your tools. As soon as you reach the end of this page, come back to this exact place and [watch The Treehouse Show](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFDA5B0CD72326128). Each week Nick Pettit and Jason Seifer's smile review the best tools, libraries, tips & tricks that you will use... a lot. By the way, if you are serious about software development, ['invest in a macbook'](http://www.powermax.com/). This is not open to debate. I am serious.

## Subscribe to Ruby Weekly

Just as the Treehouse Show offers up great weekly discussion on improving your workflow, Ruby Weekly is essential to staying on top of all things Ruby. When you ['subscribe to the Ruby Weekly newsletter'](http://rubyweekly.com/), you will have access to more than you need to know to stay on top of the Ruby community. I guarantee that if you just scan through the newsletter each week, you will find something that is relevant to what you are learning on that given week.

## Follow (and interact with) Influential Programmers

Similar to staying on top of the Ruby Weekly, it is important to follow the most influential programmers in the #{insert_your_language} language.  Don't clog your Twitter feed with Bieber, Kutcher, or whoever else is counterproductive to improving your craft. If your language of choice is Ruby, follow each one of these programmers. Right. Now.

<!-- list out a bunch of twitter handles -->

This will happen: you will find new resources before anyone else, you will discover the most relevant blogs posts and articles for learning your language*, you will voluntarily begin to unfollow that list of celebrities because they are detracting your attention from what you want to read. This is a good thing.

*you will not understand what you are reading at first. Power through it. Read it. It will make you a better programmer. The more you read, the more you will retain.

## Ask Questions

Reach out to people, ask questions, retweet, ask questions, reply to well known programmers. They will interact with you and it will make you feel special. Seriously though, at least in the Ruby community, you can ask questions to 

## Listen To Ruby Rogues
One of the best pieces of advice I received was from a Skype conversation I had with a fellow Ruby Nuby, Jeffrey Baied
